    <p>Today, we will be learning about how to make Kofta, just the way my grandma taught me.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 pound ground lamb</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons grated onion</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>28 bamboo skewers, soaked in water for 30 minutes</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mash the garlic into a paste with the salt using a mortar and pestle or the flat side of a chef's knife on your cutting board. Mix the garlic into the lamb along with the onion, parsley, coriander, cumin, cinnamon, allspice, cayenne pepper, ginger, and pepper in a mixing bowl until well blended. Form the mixture into 28 balls. Form each ball around the tip of a skewer, flattening into a 2 inch oval; repeat with the remaining skewers. Place the kebabs onto a baking sheet, cover, and refrigerate at least 30 minutes, or up to 12 hours.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil grate.</li>
        <li>Cook the skewers on the preheated grill, turning occasionally, until the lamb has cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 6 minutes for medium.</li>
    </ol>
